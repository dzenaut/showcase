Problem 10.1

1. any valid binary number

1[10]*|0

2. any even decimal number (including 0 as an even number)

[1-9]*[24680]

3. any comma-separated sequence of increasing (decimal) digits starting with a 0 (e.g.0,3,4,6,9, 0,3,5,9, and 0, but not 0,3,1 or 0,2,2)

0(,1)?(,2)?(,3)?(,4)?(,5)?(,6)?(,7)?(,8)?(,9)?

4. wrong usage of a/an (e.g. a apple and an banana, but not an apple or banana shake).It is okay, if you restrict it to cases when a is followed by a vowel and an is followed by a consonant, i.e. itâ€™s okay if you also match a university.

a\s[aeiou][a-z]*|an\s[^aeiou][a-z]*
