The eBook looks the same in two of the eBook readers (on computers). However, the appearance of the eBook changes drastically when the window is resized.
This could be alleviated by including responsive design into the stylesheet1.css file of the epub, which could not be realized till now, but could be improved in the second version.

In the third eBook reader, CSS information does not seem to be registered. The eBook basically looks like a collection of html files without css information. We assume that there is a bug with the eBook reader (or it requires features that our eBook does not take into account or vice versa).

For now, there are no changes (other than the responsive design) that could be included to improve the readability over a range of eBook readers. However, we are happy to listen to feedback and include new features in the epub files.
