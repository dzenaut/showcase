            <p>This eBook would not have been possible without the contribution of many people: Prof. Kohlhase, Antonius Hegyes and Jan Frederick Schaefer who taught us the art of crafting beautiful Ebooks. And -of course- our parents, who provided us with the opportunity to go to university. </p>
            <p>Our appreciation for a society that decided to revolutionize printed media, away from paper to efficient Ebooks, is beyond words. We are proud to witness this most fundamental change in printed media since Guttenberg. To contribute to this movement, we are happy to present you with our Ebook on Ebooks, that is aiming to help others in the process of creating Ebooks by sharing out experiences.</p>
