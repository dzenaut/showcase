          <p>Ebooks allow for a practical and fast distribution of written content. In comparison to paper, it is much more environmentally friendly, Ebooks are easier to carry around and allow everybody to travel around with their personal library. Another one of their advantages is that other forms of media, such as video, sound and audio can be included in the text. This makes for a much more complete reading experience. But the coolest thing about Ebooks is the fact that everybody can make and distribute their own.</p>
          <p>This Ebook aims to give guidance to people who are currently working on their own very first Ebook. We do not want aspiring Ebook writers to waste their creative energy on reinventing the wheel, but instead hope that all -or at least most- of their creative fortress can be directed towards the creation of great content instead of great Ebooks.</p>
